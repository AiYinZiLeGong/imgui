### Status:

To check what has been already ported and working, simply run one of the tests: [lwjgl](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/imgui/test_lwjgl.kt) or [jogl](https://github.com/kotlin-graphics/imgui/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/imgui/test_jogl.kt).

You should refer to those also to learn how to use the imgui library.


### Bugs:

- copy/cut/undo/redo text
- window resize constrains
